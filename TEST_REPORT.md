## üêõ Issues Discovered

### Issue #1: Python Version Parsing (FIXED ‚úÖ)
- **Problem**: YAML parsed `3.10` as float `3.1`
- **Impact**: All CI runs failed at Python setup step
- **Solution**: Changed to `'3.10'` (quoted string)
- **Status**: Fixed in PR #4, merged

### Issue #2: Missing requirements.txt (OPEN ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- **Problem**: CI expects `server/requirements.txt` but file doesn't exist
- **Impact**: CI still failing at dependency installation step
- **Solution Needed**: Create server/requirements.txt with FastAPI dependencies
- **Status**: Not yet addressed

### Issue #3: Default Branch Mismatch (INFO ‚ÑπÔ∏è)
- **Problem**: Default branch shows as "chore/add-playwright-tests-ci"
- **Impact**: Confusing for contributors
- **Solution Needed**: Update default branch to "main" in repo settings
- **Status**: Not critical, informational

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **YAML Gotcha**: Always quote version numbers in YAML (3.10 ‚Üí '3.10')
2. **Auto-merge Power**: GitHub auto-merge significantly speeds up workflow
3. **Early CI Testing**: Test CI workflow with minimal requirements first
4. **Issue Templates**: Automated issue creation with templates is efficient
5. **Function Persistence**: PowerShell functions need re-sourcing between commands

## üöÄ Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Create server/requirements.txt**
   ```
   fastapi
   uvicorn
   pydantic
   ```

2. üìù **Update Issue #3** with new findings

3. üîß **Set default branch** to "main" in repo settings

### Future Enhancements:
1. Add pytest for backend testing
2. Set up branch protection rules
3. Add CODEOWNERS file
4. Create issue templates in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
5. Add pull request template
